        <h1>HOW TO PLAY MASTERMIND</h1>
        <h2>1. Have the code maker select a code.</h2>
        <p>
            Mastermind board games have a row of holes set apart at one end of the board, hidden from view under a hinged shield.
            The person who plays the code maker secretly takes a few colored pegs and places them in that row of holes, in any order.
            This is the code that the code breaker will try to guess.
            <br>
            •If you're playing a video game version, the computer will usually do this instead of a player.
            <br>
            •The code maker must put a peg in every hole. He has the option to use more than one peg of the same color. For example, he could put down Green Yellow Yellow Blue.

        </p>
        <h2>2. Have the code breaker place her first guess.</h2>
        <p>
            The other player, or the only player in video game versions, tries to guess what the hidden code is.
            Sitting on the opposite end of the board, she picks up the large colored pegs and places them in the nearest row of large holes.<br>
            •For example, she could put down Blue Orange Green Purple. (Your Mastermind game might have more holes or different colored pegs.)

        </p>
        <h2>3. Ask the code maker to give feedback.</h2>
        <p>
            Next to each "guess row" is a small square with enough holes for four tiny pegs.
            These pegs only come in two colors: white and red (or white and black in some versions).
            The code maker uses this to give clues about how good the guess was.
            The code maker must be honest, and always puts down pegs using these instructions:
            <br>
            •Each white peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, but is in the wrong hole.
            <br>
            •Each red (or black) peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, and is in the right hole.
            <br>
            •The order of the white and black pegs does not matter.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Learn through examples.</h2>
        <p>
            In our example above, the code maker secretly chose Yellow Yellow Green Blue. The code breaker guessed Blue Orange Green Purple.
            The code maker looks at this guess to find out which hint pegs to place:<br>
            •Peg #1 is Blue. There is a blue in the code, but it is not in position #1. This earns a white hint peg.<br>
            •Peg #2 is Orange. There is no orange in the code, so no hint peg gets put down.<br>
            •Peg #3 is Green. There is a green in the code, and it is in position #3. This earns a red (or black) hint peg.
            <br>
            •Peg #4 is Purple. There is no purple in the code, so no hint peg gets put down.

        </p>
        <h2>5. Repeat with the next row.</h2>
        <p>
            The code breaker now has a little information. In our example, she got one white hint, one red hint, and two empty holes.
            That means of the four pegs she put down, one of them belongs but needs to be moved to a different hole, one of them is already in the right place, and two of them don't belong in the code.
            She thinks for a while and makes a second guess in the next highest row:
            <br>
            •The code breaker guesses Blue Yellow Orange Pink this time.
            <br>
            •The code maker checks this guess: Blue belongs but is in the wrong place; Yellow belongs and is in the right place; Orange doesn't belong; Pink doesn't belong.<br>
            •The code maker puts down one white hint peg and one red hint peg.

        </p>
        <h2>6. Continue until the code is guessed or there are no more guesses left.</h2>
        <p>
            The code breaker continues to make guesses, using information from all the previous hints she earned.
            If she manages to guess the complete code in exactly the right order, she wins the game.
            If she fails to guess and fills every row with pegs, the code maker wins instead.
